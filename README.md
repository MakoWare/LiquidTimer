LiquidTimer
===========

LibGDX Project
 -> Uses LiquidFun library for interesting fluid physics


I'm not sure how to compile this liquid fun extension. I haven't seen build files in xml, google tells me it's probably ant, idk, I posten on forum. fuck a duck.

It looks like the liquid fun cpp files are only 1k lines total, including the headers. I think I may make my own liquid physics based on box2d. 

I'm sick, so poke.
